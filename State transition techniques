State Transition Testing is a black-box testing technique used to test systems that behave differently based on their current state and events/actions.

It validates:

Valid state changes
Invalid state changes
Correct responses to events in different states

Components of State Transition Testing

States – different conditions of the system

Events – actions that trigger state changes

Transitions – movement from one state to another

Actions – output or behavior during transitions

Example

ATM Card System

Current State	                       Event	                          Next State
Idle	                            Insert card	                       Card Inserted
Card Inserted	                    Enter correct                      PIN	Authenticated
Card Inserted	                    Enter wrong PIN	                   Retry / Block
Authenticated	                    Eject card	                       Idle

This technique is used when:

System behavior depends on sequence of events

Application has multiple states

Past actions affect current behavior
