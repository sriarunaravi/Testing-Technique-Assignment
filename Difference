	Equivalence Partitioning (EP)	                                                                     Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
1.A black-box testing technique that divides input data into equivalence                   A black-box testing technique that focuses on testing boundary values of input ranges
  classes where all values are expected to behave the same.
                                
2.Reduce the number of test cases by selecting one                                         Detect defects that occur at the edges of input ranges
  representative value from each partition
3.Any value within the partition	                                                         Values at, just below, and just above the boundary
4.Finds general input validation errors                                                  	 Finds off-by-one errors, range errors
5.Can be used independently	                                                               Usually derived from equivalence partitions
